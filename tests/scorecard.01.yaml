# Policies
# This are documented here: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks/internal/checks.yaml
# Checks need to be explicitly defined. AllStar already calls scorecard for
# Binary-Artifacts (High), and Dangerous-Workflow (Critical)
# and has its own implementation of Branch-Protection
#
# The other Critical or High checks are:
# - Code-Review
# - Dependency-Update-Tool
# - Maintained
# - Signed-Releases
# - Token-Permissions
# - Vulnerabilities
# - Webhooks (experimental)
#checks: # AllStar already calls scorecard for Binary-Artifacts, Branch-Protection,
#  - Maintained
