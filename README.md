# allstar-schema

This project is for drafting JSON schemae for OpenSSF's Allstar tool.  They will
eventually live somewhere else, but for now, here they are.

[!CAUTION]
> This is VERY much in development and things may not work properly.

## Plans

Update the [JSON Schema Store](https://schemastore.org/) catalog with these
schema files so that tools (e.g., [v8r](https://github.com/chris48s/v8r/)) can
validate Allstar configuration files, potentially in conjunction with
[MegaLinter](https://megalinter.io/)'s YAML descriptors.
